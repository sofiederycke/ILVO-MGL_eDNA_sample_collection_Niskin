# ILVO-MGL_eDNA_sample_collection_Niskin

This repository contains the protocol and template files for water collection with a Niskin rosette: **ILVO-MGL_eDNA_sample_collection_Niskin.md**

The metadata of the cruise and samples needs to be filled into this template: **Smartfish_WaterSampling_TEMPLATE.xlsx** This allows easy upload of the sample metadata in the ILVO Smartfish Database. An R script is available to convert the metadata to the MIMARKS file of NCBI. This is the recommended metadata template for ILVO samples.

The metadata can also be stored in a template that can be directly uploaded to the Biosamples repository of NCBI: **ILVO-MGL-eDNA_sample_collection_MIMARKS.survey.water.6.0_template.xlsx**
However, this file is not compliant with the ILVO Smartfish database.
